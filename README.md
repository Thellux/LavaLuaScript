# LavaLuaScript
This is the Lua Script that I uploaded to my NodeMCU Lolin 8266 Micro Controller
This repository contains the README, the config file and the script itself.
The config file is used to store the jenkins credentials, the url to your jenkins api and the credentials for your accesspoint.
